=========

This file exists so the enclosing folder will be created and maintained even if empty. The src
folder should be populated with the output of the `slice2java` command. For example:

    $ slice2java ../../Chatter.ice

This recreates a `chatter` folder containing the generated files. Eventually this should be done
automatically by IntelliJ whenever we get around to configuring that.
